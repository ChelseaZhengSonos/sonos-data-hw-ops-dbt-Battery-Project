  - name: generate_schema_name
    description: >
      Overrides the generate_schema_name macro and use this macro to determine the name of
      the schema that a model should be built in. 
      
      If running with profile target as "dev" the normal dbt schema conventions for `target.schema` and
      `custom_schema_name` name are followed. E.g. `ODS_DEV.SCHEMA_CORE.MODEL_NAME`.

      IF running with any other profile target then we create schemas named using `custom_schema_name` only.
      E.g. `ODS_TEST.CORE.MODEL_NAME`.
      
      This macro accounts for if no custom schema name is given.
